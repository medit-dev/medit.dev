# Why do I need it ❓

Since the beginning of my journey I have been collecting and saving all interesting blogs, articles, posts .... ect. However, since a certain point:
- I find it hard to find the source of where I know it from 📚💭 
- why do I need it 🤔🎯 
- how did I come to this 🧩🔍
- and how it relates to other topics 🔗🌐.  

That is why I have decided to run my blog on the principle of [digital gardening](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) 🌱💻 and building my own knowledge base based 👩‍🌾📖 on what I find. 

This is why this repository was created, which is a kind of travel diary of all the IT nooks and crannies in which I have imprinted my IP address.
